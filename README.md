# Web & Database Security Lab

## Introduction

This lab covers various aspects of database security and web application vulnerabilities. Each section focuses on different topics and provides hands-on experience with both SQL scripts and graphical interfaces.

### Section 1: Database Creation and Manipulation

Explore the basics of creating and manipulating databases using SQL scripts and graphical interfaces. Learn essential skills for managing database structures and data efficiently.

### Section 2: Database Access Control (DAC)

Implement Database Access Control (DAC) by creating and enforcing security policies in Oracle 10g/SQL Server. Understand the significance of access control in maintaining database security.

### Section 3: Mandatory Access Control (MAC)

Ensure confidentiality and control information flow through the implementation of Mandatory Access Control (MAC) in either Oracle 10g or SQL Server. Gain insights into MAC concepts and defense against Trojan horse attacks.

### Section 4: Virtual Private Database (VPD) Implementation

Implement Virtual Private Database using views in Oracle 10g or SQL Server. Learn how to control access to sensitive data through the use of views.

### Section 5: HTML Injections and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Simulation

Design a method to simulate HTML injections and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to understand and exploit potential vulnerabilities in web applications.

### Section 6: HTML Injection Bug Detection and Prevention

Identify HTML injection bugs and implement measures to prevent HTML injection exploits. Explore best practices for securing web applications against injection attacks.

### Section 7: Secure Coding for Buffer Overflow Attacks

Implement secure coding practices to prevent buffer overflow and heap attacks. Learn techniques to safeguard applications against these common security threats.

### Section 8: Authentication Scheme Design

Develop and implement secure methods for designing authentication schemes. Understand the importance of robust authentication mechanisms in protecting web applications.

### Section 9: Abusing Design Deficiencies

Implement methods to abuse design deficiencies against web sites. Gain practical insights into potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities in web application design.
